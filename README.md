Class,
    Some were having issues with lab 5 so this code is to help guide
    you on how to implement operator overloading. If you are having trouble, please read the code and try it for youself to better understand how this works. If you have any issues or if something does not make sense, feel free to reach out to me so that I can be of assistance.

Best,
William Keller
